# Synthetic_Genesis
Custom level pack for Baba Is You. Consists of ~100 levels with a major focus on editor-exclusive words.

This pack combines my previous two packs Babasynthesis and Babamorphosis. Although the two maps are reused, major portion of these old levels have been changed. There are also a lot of new levels, so players who have completed my previous packs should still enjoy this pack.

Due to a change in the mechanics of Revert in Baba Is You version 412, my previous packs are not very playable. This pack should act as the replacement of my previous packs.

To play it: Download Babasynthesis.zip from the releases. Unzip it inside the Worlds folder of your Baba Is You local files. Currently you have to be in beta to be able to play custom level packs.

Feel free to share the pack if you find it fun. Though you should not modify and redistribute the pack without my consent.
